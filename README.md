## 🌱 What's This Session About?

Most people hear *Git* or *GitHub* and think:  
> "This is scary." 😨  
> "I'll learn it later." 🫠  
> "I'll just download ZIP." 💀  

This session **breaks that fear** with hands-on practice:

- Understand what Git actually does behind the scenes  
- Learn why GitHub exists and how to use it  
- Play with Git in a fun, chill, interactive flow  
- Make your first commits without stress or confusion  

> 🧡 **No prior experience needed. Curiosity is enough.** 🔥

***

## 🤔 So… What *Is* Git?

**Git** is a version control system that manages your code changes over time.[2]

It lets you:

- Track every single change in your project  
- Go back in time if something breaks  
- Collaborate with others without conflicts  

> 🧠 *Think of Git as: "CTRL + Z for your entire project—but smarter and permanent."*

***

## 🌍 What About GitHub?

**GitHub** is the online platform for Git repositories and collaboration.[2]

Use it to:

- Store projects in the cloud  
- Share code publicly or privately  
- Work with teams and contributors  
- Build a portfolio of your work  

> ☁️ *GitHub = "Google Drive for code + teamwork + community."*

***

## 🧪 The Practice Project

This repo contains a **simple, fun website** made with:

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

You'll use it to learn the **core Git workflow**:

- Initialize a repo  
- Make and track changes  
- Commit with meaningful messages  
- Push to GitHub  
- Safely experiment and break things 😄  

***

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```text
├── index.html   # Main page content
├── style.css    # All the styles & colors
├── script.js    # Interactive logic & fun
└── README.md    # You're reading it now!
```

> Nothing fancy. Nothing scary. Just perfect for learning Git basics.

## 🚀 Try It Yourself (Step by Step)

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhi-jithb/get-set-git.git
cd git-set-git
```

### 2️⃣ Open the project

- Double-click `index.html`  
- Open in any browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)  

> **No server needed. No setup drama. Just open and go.**

### 3️⃣ Make a small change ✨

Edit `index.html` or `script.js`:

- Change some text  
- Add a funny quote  
- Update the page title  
- Break something on purpose (you're safe 😌)

**Example** (`script.js`):
```js
console.log("Git is scary until it isn't.");
```

### 4️⃣ Check Git status

```bash
git status
```

Git shows you exactly what changed:  
> "Hey, something's different here 👀"

### 5️⃣ Add your changes

```bash
git add .
```

Tells Git:  
> "Track these files for me."

### 6️⃣ Commit your changes 🧠

```bash
git commit -m "added my first fun quote"
```

A **commit** = 📸 *Snapshot of your project right now.*

### 7️⃣ Push to GitHub 🚀

```bash
git push
```

**Boom.** Your code is now **live on GitHub** and shareable with the world 🌍

***

## 🧠 Key Things to Remember

- **Everyone** messes up Git at first  
- `git status` = your best friend forever  
- Googling error messages = normal workflow  
- **You learn by doing**, not memorizing  

***

## 😄 Beginner Thoughts vs Reality

> "What if I break the project?"  
✔ **That's how learning happens.**

> "Others know more than me."  
✔ **Everyone started exactly here.**

> "I don't get it yet."  
✔ **Perfect—you're in the growth zone.**

***

## 💡 Next Level Challenges

Once comfortable, try:

- Create/switch branches: `git branch my-feature`  
- Edit CSS colors and animations  
- Add a new button or feature  
- Fork this repo → make it yours  

> No grades. No judgment. Pure exploration.

Git might feel confusing today. **That's normal.**

Soon you'll casually run:

```bash
git push origin main
```

...and smile knowing you just shipped code like a pro 🚀
